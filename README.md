## 🔍 Contents of the Notebook
The notebook is organized in a clean and modular fashion:
- ✅ Each question and sub-part is broken into separate markdown/code cells  
- 🧠 Logical reasoning and mathematical steps (where relevant) are explained  
- 📊 Visualizations (if any) are labeled and interpreted  
- 🧪 Results are printed cleanly with comments for readability

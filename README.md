## üîé Overview
 - This repository contains my submission for the **first assignment** of Thapar's Summer School on Machine Learning.
 - Questions were provided in a structured PDF, uploaded in this repo.
 - Solutions are implemented using **Python**, mainly through **Google Colab**.

## üî¨ Methodology

S([Start question]) --> A[/Input Reading/]
A -.-> B[Mathematical Reasoning]
B -.-> C[Visualisation]
C --> D[Code logic]
D --> P[/Print Result/]
P --> E([Go to next question])
```
- Each question and sub-part is broken into separate markdown/code cells  
- Logical reasoning and mathematical steps (where relevant) are explained  
- Visualizations (if any) are labeled and interpreted  
- Results are printed cleanly with added comments for readability

## üßæ Reflections
This assignment gave me a hands-on exposure to:
- Basics of Python programming
- Clean notebook structuring along with GitHub handling
- Writing Pythonic and optimized code
- Mathematical reasoning and edge case handling
